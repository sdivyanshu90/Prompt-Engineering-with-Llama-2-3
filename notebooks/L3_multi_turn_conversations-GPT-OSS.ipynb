<br>• Boosts lung capacity <br>• Increases vitamin\\u202fD (sunlight) <br>• Strengthens legs & core | • Choose routes with varied terrain for balance work <br>• Stay hydrated & wear sunscreen <br>• Pack a light snack with protein & carbs (nuts, fruit, jerky) |\\n| **Group sports** (soccer, basketball, ultimate frisbee, pickleball) | • Cardio + strength <br>• Enhances coordination & agility <br>• Social bonding → lower stress hormones | • Warm‑up with dynamic stretches <br>• Use proper footwear to protect joints <br>• End with a cool‑down stretch to aid recovery |\\n| **Mind‑body movement** (yoga, Pilates, tai‑chi, dance class) | • Increases flexibility & core strength <br>• Lowers cortisol (stress hormone) <br>• Improves balance & posture <br>• Can be meditative → better mental clarity | • Choose a class that matches your level (beginner, flow, power) <br>• Use a mat with good grip <br>• Finish with a short breathing/meditation segment |\\n| **Water‑based fun** (swimming, stand‑up paddleboarding, water aerobics) | • Full‑body, low‑impact cardio <br>• Joint‑friendly (great for knees/hips) <br>• Improves lung function <br>• Cool temperature can reduce inflammation | • Apply waterproof sunscreen <br>• Practice proper breathing technique (exhale underwater) <br>• Hydrate before and after |\\n| **Nature immersion** (bird‑watching, botanical garden stroll, picnics in a park) | • Reduces blood pressure & heart rate <br>• Boosts mood via “forest‑bath” effect <br>• Encourages mindful presence | • Bring a reusable water bottle & healthy snacks (fruit, hummus & veggies) <br>•

(strategy, problem‑solving) <br>• Strengthens social ties → better immune function <br>• Can be low‑impact physical activity (standing, moving around) | • Choose healthier food options (vegetable‑heavy dishes, whole‑grain snacks) <br>• Take short stretch breaks if you’ll be seated for long periods |\\n| **Volunteer work** (community garden, beach clean‑up, animal shelter) | • Physical activity (lifting, walking) <br>• Sense of purpose → lower stress & depression risk <br>• Social connection | • Wear appropriate gloves & shoes <br>• Stay hydrated and bring a nutritious
